# UOCIS322 - Project 2 #

A "getting started with Docker" project for CIS 322, Introduction to Software Engineering, at the University of Oregon.

### Purpose ###

* The goal of this project is to implement the same "file checking" logic that you implemented in Project 1, but using Flask.

* Like Project 1, if a file ("name.html") exists, transmit "200/OK" header followed by that file html. If the file doesn't exist, transmit an error code in the header along with the appropriate page html in the body. Also created the following two html files with the error messages:
    * "404.html" will display "File not found!"
    * "403.html" will display "File is forbidden!"
